ofxSmile
==========

An update to http://fffff.at/auto-smiley/

Tested with 0.8.1+ on OSX.

The Original AutoSmiley is an example now.

### TODO
- Update the smile finder to find multiple faces / smiles, locate eyes, etc.  This can be done by iterating through the faces in `ofxSmile::getSmile()` and returning data for each of them.

### Note
- https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxFaceTracker may be a better option for your project.
